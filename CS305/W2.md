# Blog post 2: China as a technological dystopia

## Dystopian society

With emerging advances in AI and surveillance technology, attempt towards its integration in society rouse debate amongst
those who are not particularly fond of the the threat of misuse and corruption. In particular, China is receiving harsh criticism 
over the implementation of a social credit system along with the usage of facial recognition software in CCTV security cameras.
News sources describe China as a totalitaian dystopian, not unlike the dystopia crafted by American author George Orwellian 
in his book <u>1984</u>. <br />

In a similar fashion as the negative feelings toward government surveillance, critics of China are appaled by the usage of
a social credit system for ranking individuals based on what is deemed as 'good' and 'bad' behavior. This method of behavior
control is directly compared to as similar system seen in the episode 'NoseDive' from the British television show 'Black Mirror.' 
In this episode, citizens are perscribed a number rating that is affected by everyday interactions; in a given space, people are
able to upvote or downvote each other to affect their social credit score. 

The story follows a woman who is caught under a line of unfortunate circumstances that lead her to drop from a good social
score to a pitiful one, all in the matter of a few hours. As skeptics of the Chinese social credit system are keen to point out,
this same fate is bound to happen to normally upstanding, law abiding Chinese citizens who are forced to 'misbehave' due to
a bad day or forces out of their control.
