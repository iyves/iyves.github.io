## Dystopian society

With emerging advances in AI and surveillance technology, attempt towards its integration in society rouse debate amongst
those who are not particularly fond of the the threat of misuse and corruption. In particular, China is receiving harsh criticism 
over the implementation of a social credit system along with the usage of facial recognition software in CCTV security cameras [3, 6, 9].
News sources describe China as a totalitaian dystopian, not unlike the dystopia crafted by American author George Orwellian 
in his book <u>1984</u>[4]. <br />

In a similar fashion to the negative feelings toward government surveillance, critics of China show dissatisfaction with the usage of
a social credit system for ranking individuals based on what is deemed as 'good' and 'bad' behavior. This method of behavior
control is directly compared to as similar system seen in the episode 'NoseDive' from the British television show 'Black Mirror.' 
In this episode, citizens are perscribed a number rating that is affected by everyday interactions; in a given space, people are
able to upvote or downvote each other to affect their social credit score [3]. 

The story follows a woman who is caught under a line of unfortunate circumstances that lead her to drop from a good social
score to a pitiful one, all in the matter of a few hours. As skeptics of the Chinese social credit system are keen to point out,
this same fate is bound to happen to normally upstanding, law abiding Chinese citizens who are forced to 'misbehave' due to
a bad day or forces out of their control.<br /><br />

Perhaps the events that occur in 'Nosedive' seem exaggerated, but news articles and western sources of media insist that it
is a very possible occurance in the society that China is headed toward. However, while there is a lot of discussion 
circulating the possible affects of a social credit system, there is little talk about exactly _how_ the system works
and the Chinese perspective on the matter.<br/>

## Impression of China from the perspective of Western media
To better understand why news articles are quick to cast China in a negative light, it's important to understand how
China is personified in Western media.
Western news outlets are guilty of representing China in a negative manner: sometimes referring to Chinese practices as old [9]
or fundametally flawed in some manner or another - a stark parallel to the new, democratic societies of Europe and America [8].
In the past, news articles presented either inaccurate or incomplete information regarding Chinese current events, which
spreads incorrect assumptions about life in the red country. For example, in 2014, news sites included a picture of 
Tiananmen Square in Beijing that commented on the pollution of the city, stating that the pollution caused officials to
display sunrises on large billboard signs in answer to the smog. <br />

[2] _Picture in question misused by news sites._<br /><br />

Although the picture in question is alarming and meant to shock viewers, the story associated with it is completely false [2, 5].
In reality, the billboard is a running ad for a travel agency, completely defying the allegations of Chinese officials using
a display of a sunset to combat pollution. After some backlack for spreading false information, news outlets have slightly
modified their articles slightly, but have not changed their clickbait headlines, which seek to shock and appal readers [2, 5].
Although pollution is a real problem in China, this misinformation is a way of 
using shock and fear to garner negative feelings towards China, rather than addressing Chinese issues accurately and seriously.<br />

In more recent news, western media is quick to jump on the offensive side against China by mentioning an incident where a Chinese
high school student was denied entry to a college despite his strong performance on all entrace exams due to the poor social
credit score of his father [8]. In another case, citizens may be prevented from purchasing airplane, train tickets, or booking 
luxury hotels as a result of their bad social credit score, which can be accompanied with being on a government black list [8].<Br />

What these outlets fail to mention is the Chinse public's reaction and the reasons for which a person can accrue negative social
credit. In terms of the student who was denied entry to college, the public was outraged and strongly opposed how the college
treated the student, arguing that, if a son is to be punished for his father's actions, then similar punishment should follow
corrupt politicians and their children [11]. <br /><br />

[11] _A stark contrast between how the west and China view the social credit system._<br /><br />

Citizens placed on black lists are generally guilty of public offenses such as stealing, failure to pay fines, or violating traffic 
laws. The reasoning for barring black listed citizens from purchasing tickets or renting hotel rooms is that, if the offender
does not have enough money to pay off their debts, then they should not be able to purchase unnecessary luxuries. There are
a number of blacklists for everything - from bike sharing companies to banks to the government, individuals can be listed on
one or many of these lists. Again, outlets fail to remind readers of similar American systems, where "courts and law enforcement
officers can seize assets or skim off wages to force compliance with a civil judgement," and " millions of Americans had their
driver's license revoked due to unpaid traffic fines" [11]. <br />

What is concerning, however, is that 'bad behavior' worthy of being placed on a governmental
black list is up to the discretion of the government [11]. This risks punishment for political dissent or holding 
unpopular opinions. While skepticism is healthy in the debate over China's social credit system, it is wrong
to assume that western systems are not guilty of similar practices. Truly, China's social credit should "prompt
more public debate on aspects of concern in our own systems" [11].<br /><br />

## What actually are the social credit systems?
Let's take a closer look at the Chinese social credit system. In actuality, the system is composed of two different, separate credit
systems: the government credit system, which is set to be used in 2020; and another system owned by the Chinese company 'Alibaba' [7].
This second system, dubbed 'sesame credit,' is moderated by Alibaba - a popular all-in-one mobile application for Chinese
citizens that functions like Amazon, Uber, and paypal all in one. Sesame credit is the one that assigns a numerical score to citizens,
which can be impacted from certain purchases (video games, alcohol) and association with others who have either high or low credit scores.
This opt-in system displays the user's credit score whenever upon purchasing something on the Alibaba app, and can have some 
benefits for those who have high scores. Scores range from 350 and 950, and high scoring users have access to exclusive
discouts and may be waived from paying a deposit for library books or renting bikes [7].<Br/><br/>

[7] _A score of 385 is described to be in the low range, while 731 being in the good range._<br/><br/>

These credit scores are well received by the public, with citizens going so far as to display their credit score on their
dating profile to attract potential partners [11]. China has a high level of corruption and crime. It is not uncommon, especially of the
elder generation, to observe a lack of social manners in public - people littering, jay walkin, and spitting on sidewalks.
Due to this, some applaud the efforts of Alibaba and the government. The possible negative effects connected to misbehavior
and crime are enough to convince citizens to observe the laws.

## Should China be scared?
China has been technologically progressing at a rate quicker than it can accomodate. The technology that we are seeing
being developed and integrated into Chinese society are upgrades to better and more efficiently enforce already existing
laws and regulation. I believe that concern of using technology to craft a social credit score on a person, and using 
that score to deny acces to certain resources is very dangerous to democratic society and prone to corruption and
abuse from those who make the decisions on what increases or decreases one's score. Perhaps governments should consider
popular vote for making these decisions, such that the rules can be decided by the public, rather than a small circle of
political elites.

With current discussion over the Chinese credit system, criticisms are missing a huge point: their fears of oppression are
*already* being seen in western China, embodied through the cultural genocide of Uighurs in the Xinjiang province. In cities,
social credit systems may do very well, but in rural areas and cities with large populations of foreign populations (non-Han Chinese
residents), corrupt officials intimidate residents to certain behaviors that are then later deemed to be bad or suspicious,
landing otherwise innocent citizens on the government's blacklist of untrustworthy individuals [1].

What started as an effort to quell terrorist attacks in the oil-rich city turned into an indiscriminate round-up of any and all
Uighur citizens - regarless of whether or not they are a practicing muslim. In this case, facial recognition and the social credit
system is used to identify Uighurs in large crowds and place them under close surveillance, even sending them to re-education camps [1].

While the Chinese social credit system has a clear benefit in the potential for encouraging positive behavior and discouraging 
negative behavior, it is unclear as to what exacly 'is' good or bad behavior, and who makes these decisions. In the Chinese
cultural context, a social credit system is the natural progression of law enforcement and actually celebrated as an effective means of this.
Nevertheless, many western media outlets take this system out of its cultural context, trying to compare it to their own cultural
contexts. In doing this, their criticisms fall short of the actual concerning matters occuring in other parts of China. In future discussions
regarding technology and China's social credit system, I believe that inclusion of a Chinese perspective is integral for ensuring
that the cultural context of China is considered, and so that articles do not become echo chambers of inaccurate shock-enducing information.
