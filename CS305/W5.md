## Role models and social expectations

All societies have a recognizable, defined image of what an ideal citizen looks like. Throughout
history, these ideals have been shaped by gender roles and ideas of femininity versus masculinity
in various societal facets. Often, gender roles define what the business sphere and domestic corner
of life *ought* to look like. While these standards have and still exist, they are incarnated
differently through technology.

Celebrities - actors, musicians, and models - set the standard for what is deemed positive by society.
American women of the 1950s strove to look like Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis Presley was (and still is) an icon of
the ideal American man since the mid 1900s. The gender roles of the time denied many women of a career other
than house wife - part of the 'American dream' with the nuclear family with two kids +1 dog, a white picket
fence and beautiful green grass that perfectly frame an impeccible two-story house.

Newspapers, magazines, and television served as the primary methods for spreading and popularizing (normalizing?)
these societal ideals. While the American dream proved to be difficult to achieve for a majority of Americans,
it was still a life that was theoretically attainable. However, the advent of the Internet and personal computers
changed the way that societal ideals were presented and created. <br/>


# Magazines

The first decade of the 21st century saw an increase in usage of a certain type of software that pushed societal
expectations to a level that is literally impossible to achieve. This software, in particular Photoshop, allowed
marketers to manipulate images of celebrities. Slowly, perfect, symmetrical 'aliens' began to appear on all the 
magazines that lined the check-out aisles in every store. Long slender arms and legs, ripped abs, flawless skin
texture and tone - these are all chracteristics that appeared in every American magazine, which defied the 
reality of what the celebrity *actually* looks like! How can the general public be expected to look like these
flawless specimens when the models themselves don't even resemble the images? [5]

In the second decade, the smartphone rose to popularity and made magazines as well as newspapers obsolete. However,
social expectations and photo manipulation did not become subject to the same fate. In all actuality, the smart 
lead to the complete opposite result! Whereas Photoshop and previous methods of photo manipulation were too costly
for most people, smart phones offered a plethora of free and simple apps that was widely accessible to the general
  public. Snapchat, instagram, and facetun are the cowning apps responsible for this in the American context.<br/>

# Facetune and filters
In Asia, apps like Meitu, Line, and Kakao talk popularized instant photo manipulation via filters [5].
Characteristics held valuable to Asian society, such as fair porcelain skin, large doll eyes, and a thin nose and chin, 
could be applied to any picture with the swipe of a finger. In the American context, snapchat gives users
access to the very same functionality, but with more American features like brighter eyes, a thinner jaw line, and longer eye lashes. All apps also allow users to play around with their presentation, such as appearing to be a demon or dog - the 'pretty' filter isn't the limit. Nevertheless,
it is the most popular and widely used due to its ability to instantly enhance the appearance of a user.

As Denis points out in his video, these filters are so popular because the make people feel good about themselves.
The filters present a slightly different, but improved version of the user without any blemishes or imperfections.
Users of mobile photo manipulation tools stress this point: the picture that is being edited really *is* the user,
but with just the ever most slightest amount of improvement. Surely, hiding imperfections and filtering out
imperfections won't lead to any problems with body image, right?

It is widely accepted that this is wrong. A huge issue with this technology and its application in today's society
is seen in bridging the gap between society and its expectations. With magazines and television, only celebrities
were able to get even close to appearing as ideals - the software for photo manipulation was too expensive,
difficult to use, and didn't create a result that was always realistic. Smartphone apps in conjunction with
social media (especially Instagram) allows any person to appear as an ideal. <br/>

# Social media influencers

The term "social media influencer" has been become more in use as social media celebrities become a part of the lives
and social ideals of youth. As is revealed by a large number of social media stars who buckle under the pressure
or keeing up their image of a perfect and beautiful life, the social impact of widespread, easily accessible photo
manipulation software becomes apparent. As social media influencer Gloom states, she leaves her boyfriend to do all
the photo editing for her brand, as she is very prone to making very not-so-slight edits to hide her imperfections [4].<br/>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zsxSMdFC20E?start=167" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/>
4. A social influencer with half a million reveals her addiction to maintaining a fake online life for the sake of followers [2]. <br/><br/>

Little edits here are there, a diet or two - these seemingly miniscule actions have severly negative impacts on not
only the social media celebrities themselves, but also on the hundreds of thousands of followers viewing the 
pictures every day and being lead to believe that the photo manipulation is actually real, attainable life. As was
seen with photoshop and the models, these celebrities do not even resemble the life they are putting out on the web,
yet they continue to display their picture perfect life due to social expectation pressures. It doesn't lead to happiness,
but rather self hate and an addiction to the numbers game that is gaining likes and follows.

In the previous example, the model displayed her editted life as if it were her real life. In that case, would the 
social impact of photo manipulation software change if she were to be completely transparent about her usage of 
such apps? From the opinion of social influencer James Charles, photo editting and touchups are socially acceptable
so long as the result has the user still recognizable and without any new features (adding makeup, enlarging body features, etc.).
As he explains, the action of putting on makeup, clothing, and taking the picture itself has just as much impact on a photo and 
is as much of an art as facetuning is. He adds, that such a software is acceptable to use so long as one is transparent about
using the software and does not 'cross any lines.' However, the lines are not so obvious or widely agreed upon.

# Surgery on a phone

Really, facetune and filters is like having the ability to get plastic surgery on your phone. The changes are
so slight but add up to create a noticably different depiction of the user. And when these tools become used
so often and the manipulated images are shown through social media so widely, users begin to feel a stronger
pull towards getting actual plastic surgey to have their physical body match their online persona [1].
Whether plastic surgery is moral or socially acceptable or not is relevant to the topic of photo editing, but
is a different discussion for a different time.
When facetune breeds shame for unique personal features and lead to plastic surgery, many concerns are brought
up regarding exactly why the personal features are seen with such disdain.

# Erasure of cultural features

Often times, this shame is based upon conflicting ideas of beauty in a country that many Americans describe as
a "mixing pot" of cultures. In one case, a prominent nose that is held with pride in one country is seen as
disgusting and witch-like in America, where the beauty standard is a long, thin nose with prominent nose-bridge.
While this may not seem like such a large problem, another more concerning trend is being seen in modified pictures:
skin tone changing. 

Beyonce, Adriana Grande, and many other artists have come under fire for making their skin darker or lighter to
fit a certain race ideal. In one case, its a sign of discrimination against darker skin tones, which is widely
known as colorism. In the other case, its a sign of cultural appropriation and trying to paint oneself with
certain cultural features that do not belong to them and are seen as 'ghetto' or 'dirty' on citizens who
naturally have said features. Snapchat filters have been suspected of skin lightening with filters, which has 
an impact of further separating citizens based on darkness of skin tone. In South Africa, this creates
a preference for lighter skin and promotes the usage of illegal skin whitening products that lead to 
serious health problems like sensitivity to the sun and skin cancer [5].

# Conclusion

Photo manipulation software not only allows one to slightly edit their body, but also allows them to hide away from
certain problems such as lack of fitness or bad diet, and can hide or worsen mental problems surrounding body image
and social expectations. However, this software is integral to members of the trans community who praise the software
that allows them to view their own bodies in a way that is more consistent to their expectations. In this instance, 
photo editing combats feelings of gender dysphoria and body dysmorphic disorder, which is an obviously positive 
result.

In lieu of surgery or hormone treatements, which take a long time and a lot of money before producing any
signiticant results, photo manipulation can create a persona or image that a trans person may identify with better
than their actual, physical self. This is different from social influences who edit their photos and post a false
'perfect' life on the internet and feel disconnected from their online presence.

I think that there are many positive impact that widespread, easily accessible photo manipulation technology has for
society. Although it makes it so much easier for any person to create a false version of themself and fosters
negative feelings about one's body image, it certainly opens up the question of how social expectations and beauty 
standards are defined. Rather than having companies push magazines with fit and beautiful celebrities to sell a profit,
social media influences are speaking out and challenging these standards that tend to limit the opportunities and 
potential of minorities. 

Nevertheless, in an interconnected society where image is held at high regard, perhaps this technology will just 
become a mandatory part of everyday and business life, rather than a tool for insecure youth and celebrities.
