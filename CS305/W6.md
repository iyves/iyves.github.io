The radical influence that digital technology has on how people in a society view one another is obvious. Smartphones allow face to face conversation between two people on the oposite ends of the Eartch with almost no lag - there is absolutely no way that digital technology had _not_ changed societies. However, something that is not quite so obvious is the manner in which digital technology shapes the way that people view and interact with the city.

Cities are theatres - there is always life, drama, or some type of spectacle occuring at all times. People come to the city for opportunities, anonymity, career growth, finding themselves - and so many othe reasons associated with positive growth. But as more people flow into the city for a new life, the city becomes more and more crowded, skyrocketing prices for everyday amenities, transportation, and housing. A deficit of space to accomodate city immigrants gives rise to the phenomena of urban sprawl, which is unplanned urban growth over a large area.<Br/><br/>

City planners always struggle with the question of accomodating large amounts of residents. A large city requires sophisticated and well thought-out transportations, whether that be in the form of public transportation or roads, and as rich immigrants occupy city centers, the people who are worst impacted by urban sprawl are low income residents, who are forced to move further and further away from their jobs and cultural centers. The unplanned nature of urban sprawl means poor or non-existant public transportation, causing an enormous percent of city space being allocated to roads and parking. Horrible traffic is an inevitability, and the creation of more roads or lanes has shown to not improve the situation.

Most concerning is the ecological footprint that cities have on the environment. Emmissions from cars, littering, energy and water usage, and destructions of natural space for more land is leading humanity and all life to extinction. The effects of climate change are devastating, and marine life suffers from the amount of trash and especially plastic thrown in the ocean. Rather than accepting this terrible fate, many urban planners, enterpreneurs, and a small amount of politicians are looking into ways of implementing technology in cities to mitigate pollution and resource consumption.

This is the basis for the creation of smart city. By using technology and proper urban planning, cities can be structured and organized in the most energy efficient manner. These cities focus on properly using sensors and digital technology to make cities eco-friendly, increase urban density, and promote a culture that values and respects the envornments. Rather than a city of concrete and steel that shows a feat of mastery over nature, urban planners embrace nature in their smart city designs.

Let's look at some examples of smart cities around the world and how successful they are at accomplishing this goal.


## Singapore

First and foremost, Singapore is considered to be one of the most successful modern cities at achieving the smart city dream. A city-state in the Malay peninsula that is half the size of metropolitan London and houses over 5.7 million people [3:04, National Geographic], 23% of Singapore is built on land that was reclaimed from the ocean [5:00, National Geographic]. Having achieved massive economic growth since its separation from Malaysia in 1965, Singapore is a densely populated city-state that is planned to be perfect for citizens.<br/><Br/>

Buildings are built to make best use of the tropical breeze [5:00, National Geographic], there are complex systems of underground infrastructure for transporting water and materials, highways, public transportation, and walkways [7:00 National Geographic]. Additionally, the city uses new technology to innovate urban agriculture and reclaim water from rain and the ocean [13:00, 20:00, National Geographic]. Singaporean innovators are looking at utilizing air space and drone technology to streamline delivery systems for mail, groceries, and otehr goods [9:38, National Geographic].

The city is built in a way that takes nature into consideration and local laws prevent behaviors that harm the environment. There are a number of green coridors around the city that combine nature with the urban environment and apps that encourage users to discover and document local wildlife and flora [41:05, National Geographic]. Littering can lead to a $1,000 fine for first time offenders and up to $5,000 fine for repeat offenders, as well as obligatory community service [James-Civetta]. The cost of cars in Singapore is based on five factors that make a $17k car cost over $100k [Ho]. Clearly, the city is serious about its eco-friendly practices!

Let's look at a similar smart city built on reclaimed land that was build on the same smart city principles as Malaysia, Songdo.

## Songdo 송도국도시
In South Korea, Songdo is a smart city, or, through the korean term - 'u' or 'ubiquitos' city (u시티). This city, where technology is ubiquitous, is situated 2 hours from Seoul and is has been said to complete in 2015, and then 2018, and now 2022 [White]. Despite the ever-changing completion date, this smart city boasts a sophisticated

- Smart city, called 'U' city, ubiquitous city
- Why? Population growth
- Weapon to fight trade wars in Asia
- REclaimed land
- Produces a familiar feeling
- Ghost city? TOo many cities built, not enough time for people to be used to it (13:00)
- Need time for people to move into city (17:00)
- 2 hours from Seoul
- CCTVs
- 19:00 - garbage system 
- 21:00 - Trash on streets, but this is also in reg Korea, conflicting ideas of garbage management w/ businesses
- 26:00 - Acceptance of being watched, to be able to watch
- 29:30 - gardeners take over vacant land plots
- 30:30 - Not much culture, modern, but no clture
  31:00 - It's a blank canvas, awating nerw artists
- 30:40 - Says it's great, but who can afford to live there?


## Kazakhstan

3:30 - Cities inheritantly don't compete with each other
  - best practices of ecological urban, spread it around
6:30 - Cheaper to drive to store to buy fruit, than to buy local in peru?
6:55 - Citis are getting rid of highways
  - more transportation choices, less parking
11:33 - Lost sense of hearing from the people
12:07 - Using what works in a culture before trying to convene
