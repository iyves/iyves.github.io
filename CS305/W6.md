The radical influence that digital technology has on how people in a society view one another is obvious. Smartphones allow face to face conversation between two people on the oposite ends of the Eartch with almost no lag - there is absolutely no way that digital technology had _not_ changed societies. However, something that is not quite so obvious is the manner in which digital technology shapes the way that people view and interact with the city.

Cities are theatres - there is always life, drama, or some type of spectacle occuring at all times. People come to the city for opportunities, anonymity, career growth, finding themselves - and so many othe reasons associated with positive growth. But as more people flow into the city for a new life, the city becomes more and more crowded, skyrocketing prices for everyday amenities, transportation, and housing. A deficit of space to accomodate city immigrants gives rise to the phenomena of urban sprawl, which is unplanned urban growth over a large area.<Br/><br/>

City planners always struggle with the question of accomodating large amounts of residents. A large city requires sophisticated and well thought-out transportations, whether that be in the form of public transportation or roads, and as rich immigrants occupy city centers, the people who are worst impacted by urban sprawl are low income residents, who are forced to move further and further away from their jobs and cultural centers. The unplanned nature of urban sprawl means poor or non-existant public transportation, causing an enormous percent of city space being allocated to roads and parking. Horrible traffic is an inevitability, and the creation of more roads or lanes has shown to not improve the situation.

Most concerning is the ecological footprint that cities have on the environment. Emmissions from cars, littering, energy and water usage, and destructions of natural space for more land is leading humanity and all life to extinction. The effects of climate change are devastating, and marine life suffers from the amount of trash and especially plastic thrown in the ocean. Rather than accepting this terrible fate, many urban planners, enterpreneurs, and a small amount of politicians are looking into ways of implementing technology in cities to mitigate pollution and resource consumption.

This is the basis for the creation of smart city. By using technology and proper urban planning, cities can be structured and organized in the most energy efficient manner. These cities focus on properly using sensors and digital technology to make cities eco-friendly, increase urban density, and promote a culture that values and respects the envornments. Rather than a city of concrete and steel that shows a feat of mastery over nature, urban planners embrace nature in their smart city designs.

Let's look at some examples of smart cities around the world and how successful they are at accomplishing this goal.


## Singapore

First and foremost, Singapore is considered to be one of the most successful modern cities at achieving the smart city dream. A city-state in the Malay peninsula that is half the size of metropolitan London and houses over 5.7 million people [3:04, National Geographic], 23% of Singapore is built on land that was reclaimed from the ocean [5:00, National Geographic]. Having achieved massive economic growth since its separation from Malaysia in 1965, Singapore is a densely populated city-state that is planned to be perfect for citizens.<br/><Br/>

Buildings are built to make best use of the tropical breeze [5:00, National Geographic], there are complex systems of underground infrastructure for transporting water and materials, highways, public transportation, and walkways [7:00 National Geographic]. Additionally, the city uses new technology to innovate urban agriculture and reclaim water from rain and the ocean [13:00, 20:00, National Geographic]. Singaporean innovators are looking at utilizing air space and drone technology to streamline delivery systems for mail, groceries, and otehr goods [9:38, National Geographic].

The city is built in a way that takes nature into consideration and local laws prevent behaviors that harm the environment. There are a number of green coridors around the city that combine nature with the urban environment and apps that encourage users to discover and document local wildlife and flora [41:05, National Geographic]. Littering can lead to a $1,000 fine for first time offenders and up to $5,000 fine for repeat offenders, as well as obligatory community service [James-Civetta]. The cost of cars in Singapore is based on five factors that make a $17k car cost over $100k [Ho]. Clearly, the city is serious about its eco-friendly practices!

Let's look at a similar smart city built on reclaimed land that was build on the same smart city principles as Malaysia, Songdo.

## Songdo 송도국도시
In South Korea, Songdo is a smart city, or, through the korean term - 'u' or 'ubiquitos' city (u시티). This city, where technology is ubiquitous, is situated 2 hours from Seoul and is has been said to complete in 2015, and then 2018, and now 2022 [White]. Despite the ever-changing completion date, this smart city boasts a sophisticated garbage collection system that involves the usage of trash chutes to a centralized processing facility, energy efficient homes and buildings and a plethora of pedestrian and bicycle lanes [19:00, 3ZK].

As some residents are keen to note, the current state of the city is perhaps not exactly what urban planners had in mind when designing Songdo. Although the city is beautiful and a landmark in applied technological innovation, it pales in comparison to the success of Singapore. Views of the wide highways and open business centers showcase extravagent, efficient architecture, but there is just one thing missing - the people. Songdo is designed to support up to 300,000 residents, yet the population fails to reach even half that amount. [White]

Empty plots in the city are overtaken by residents of the city, who use the space as farms and garderns [29:30, 3ZK]. These pockets of unused land remind residents of city's age. Songdo is a city that certainly lacks a culture and does not house a sizeable population [30:30, 3ZK]. Nevertheless, it is a city that is still developing - 10 years is not enough time for the city to develop to a point where residents can view the city as their own city, their home.<br/><br/>

Being in such an international city produces a familiar feeling, like one has already seen the city somewhere. In conjunction with the newness of the city, this can create the feeling that the city doesn't compare culturally to its counterpart cities that have a history and set of traditions. On the otherhand, to artists and musicians, this is a blank canvas - a space where people can project their creativity and form the city into what they want it to be [3ZK, 31:00].

Songdo implements another feature that is commonplace to most, if not all smart cities: urban surveillance through the usage of CCTVs. These monitoring systems can not only capture crime and protect citizens  - that would not be enough for a smart city. CCTVS in smart cities also act as sensors that monitor and inform about various conditions around the city, such as temperature, humidity or traffic. In this new city, concerns about privacy and data security are worth the sacrifice for the sake of convenience and the ability to better surveil and monitor one's **own** property [3ZK, 26:00].

The main critisisms towards Songdo - lack of culture and small population - can all be explained by how quickly the city was built and how long it has existed. The culture is slowly but surely growing in Songdo, with residents adding their own pieces of culture to the city. In terms of population, it takes many years for a socal ecosystem to be established in one area of a city, let alone for the entire city itself [17:00 3ZK]. Songdo is referred to as a ghost city, yet it was built in ten years and is still in development. As Wade Shepard states, "the reaction from the outside should probably be that of amazement, rather than ... 'yeah, but where's all the people'" [13:00, 3ZK]. 

Songdo is an intriguing city that makes usage of technology to reduce its ecological footprint. Yet there are many steps that politicians and business owners must take if the city is to become a successful model. For instance, littering is a common occurance due to the lack of trashcans as a result of a centralized garbage collection system [21:00, 3ZK]. Creating a centralized garbage system, in my opinion, does not address the issue of how many products are packaged with sometimes ridiculous amounts of plastic. Rather than focusing on the root of the problem - garbage production from consumerist packaging - the city places a temporary, reactive solution that creates other problems - littering, rather than fixing the problem.

Additionally, this city is inaccessible and not feasible for low income residents. I'm not sure how well the city accomodates residents with disabilities, but this business district is made specifically for upper middle and high class residents. Rather than bringing people together, maybe this city will only further separate people on the basis of economic status and hide poverty. Nevertheless, I am interested to see how scalable this city is and whether or not it will succeed in the future.<br/><br/>
