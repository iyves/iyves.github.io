# Blog post 7: The Youtube Algorithm

Do you remember the first video that you saw on Youtube? I certainly do. Back when I was a young
boy and lived in the ever-warm state of Hawaii, I was browing through some homepages on the website
Neopets. It was here that I stumbled upon an embedded youtube video of pokemon dancing to an at the
time popular slice of life anime, "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya." <br/><br/>

Youtube is a social media video sharing platform that popularised vlogging as well as viral videos.
Having been launched in early 2005, the website has seen a fair amount of changes in the past 14 years [DomainTools].
On of the largest changes is the user base. Youtube is an extremely successful, active site with over 
a billion users [Youtube]. However, this prestige does not come without challenges: in just one day, about 65 years
worth of videos are uploaded - that's 576k hours [Barker]!

With so much incoming content, it's impossible to ensure that each and every video follows the community guidelines.
The logical next step to solving this problem is to look towards technology: instead of limiting the amount of incoming 
videos or trusting the community to report videos that break the community's guidelines, Youtube employs an algorithm
that serves multiple purposes: detect videos that conflict the guidelines, detect and manages cases of copyright, decide
which videos are advertiser friendly, and reccomend videos for users to watch.

# The Algorithm
Youtube tries to be as transparent as possible when it comes to how its algorithms are implemented. In 2016, Youtube even
released a research paper on how Youtube researchers use deep neural networks to decide which videos to reccommend [Covington].
There are even courses created by Youtube and support pages detailing exactly how their system works [Youtube1, Youtube2].
Here is a table by Youtube that nicely encompass exactly what each policy entails:

|I'm interested in... | I should check out ...|
| Using a YouTube product or service | YouTube's Terms of Service |
| Uploading content or commenting on a video | YouTube's Community Guidelines |
| Understanding copyright ownership | YouTube's Copyright website |
| Making videos visible to all ages | YouTube's age-restricted content guidelines |
| Earning money on YouTube 	YouTube's Partner Program policies |
| Creating content suitable for ads |	YouTube's advertiser-friendly content guidelines |
_[Youtube1] Summary of Youtube guidelines and policies._<br/>

The goal of these guidelines, courses, and support pages is to empower creators and improve the overall quality of 
the content that appears on the site. Nevertheless, theory rarely perfectly map out to practice.
Rather than empowering creators, many feel that Youtube's algorith is stifling, unfair, and most of all just plain
terrible.

Part of this comes from a prevalent feeling of uncertainly when unloading content. Regardless of how
transparent Youtube may be of their guidelines and policies, content creators have found and experienced
consequences that contradict these guidelines. Additionally, there are many grey areas that significantly
complicate how an algorithm views a video.<Br/><Br/>

## Youtube Terms of Service

In Youtube's terms of service, point E of guideline 4 states prohibits commercial usage of a video that is
not original. This does not define what 'original' means -- what of the react channels that 'remix' a video
by basically reuploading a video and recording their reaction to the video for a profit? How about the numerous Russian
youtube channels that upload dubbed-over versions of videos and still gain ad revenue?

## Youtube Community Guidelines
In the community guidelines, Youtube explains that users can flag content that appears to break policy or guidelines.
Accoring to them, each flagged video is judged on a case to case situation. This doesn't stop users from flagging
videos that do not deserve being flagged. Additionally, there are many videos that clearly infringe Youtube's policies and
law, yet they remain for a long period of time before any action from the side of Youtube takes place. For example,
- child abuse, exploitation, pornography

## Youtube Copyright website
Copyright is a very important factor to check in videos. This is more of a legal requirement, to comply with
DMCA rules. If the Youtube algorithm identifies a video as breaking copyright rules, then all of the profit
from that video may go to the party that claims copyright and in some cases, videos are taken down entirely.
Once again, there are many instances where this algorithm makes a mistake, for example musicians and producers
getting having their video content claimed by themselves [Ernesto].<br/>

_[Ernesto] The Youtube algorithm decided that Dan Bull's content infringes upon copyright guidelines, and has 
the video claimed by the content owner, who happens to be Dan Bull himself._<br/><Br/>

## Youtube Age-restricted Content Guidelines

Another important legal regulation involves age restriction. If a video has material that is inappropriate for
children, such as videos that have "vulgar language, violence and disturbing imagery, nudity and sexually
suggestive content, and a portrayal of harmful or dangerous activities" [Youtube3], then it can be age-restricted. Age-restricted videos are not viewable to people under 18 years of age and viewers who are logged out [Youtube3].

Age-restricting content made Youtube a lot safer for children to view, and crippled some channels that depended 
on cruel public pranks, violence, and softcore porn for survival. Nevertheless, there exist collections of easily
accessible content that are not age restricted.

Youtuber MattsWhatItIs exposes how simple it is for a completely new Youtube user to get from the homepage to 
sexually explotative videos of children after just searching 'bikini haul' and two clicks. These videos are
reuploaded by channels dedicated to collecting this content, filled with comments of emails where viewers
share child pornography, and timestamps to certain spots in the video that feature the child in a sexual manner,
accompanied with comments of a sexual nature [MattsWhatItIs]. These videos have existed for over two years
and continue to thrive with ads that generate income, until backlash from the Youtube community and advertisers
pushed this issue to the forefront of Youtube's mind. <Br/><Br/>

exploitation._<br/><br/>

Another sketchy trend of child exploitation was seen earlier in 2017. From the years 2014 to 2017, strange animations
and videos of popular disney and marvel characters started to appear throught Youtube with a large amount of views.
In these videos, the characters would always engage in some kind of either violent, sexual, or just otherwise innappropriate
activity. Strangely enough, a large percent of views that these videos had came from a sister app Youtube Kids, whose
goal is to "make it safer and simpler for kids to explore the world through online video" [Youtube4].

This phenomena is named Elsagate, and there is a whole subreddit dedicated to understanding the intricacies around the
youtube genre [Elsagate]. Interestingly enough, after Youtube's regulations on prank channels, some prank youtubers
turned to creating Elsagate content in search of alternative means for generating profit [h3h3Productions].<Br/><br/>

## Youtube Partner Program policies
To speed the process of video validation for certain well-known and trusted content creators, Youtube
has a special program, the Youtube Partner Program. Youtube chooses specific creators to be a part of 
the program, and participants enjoy benefits such as  (). Unfortunately, this system seems to have done
a lot of harm for the platform after events in 2018 regarding an infamous participant of the program.

On (), Logan Paul and his filming crew shot a video wherein the team explores Mount Fuji in Japan.
This mountain is well known in Japan as a spot for committing suicide. It even gained the name
'suicide mountain,' amongst the internet. It is not suprising, then, that Logan Paul stumbled
upon a hanging carcass. What is surprising is how Logan Paul mistreats and disrespects this 
body by filming it, joking around, and even featuring it in the thumbnail of his video.

This is just one of many controversies that Logan Paul is responsible for, but the key factor
which enraged Youtube users is Youtube's response. Even though the video thumbnail included
an actual dead body, Youtube's algorithm didn't find a problem at all and even promoted the
video to the site's trending page. Additionally, Jake's television series with Youtube was 
only temporarily cancelled after backlash from the community, but still aired whereas popular
content creator PewDiePie's red series was cancelled altogether for making nazi jokes.

This of course happens at a time when many other popular content creators discuss their suspicions
over Youtube's algorithm due to issues with monetization, new videos not being displayed on 
subscribers' home page, and extremely popular videos not appearing on the trending page. This proved
to many Youtube creators and viewers that Youtube does not care about its audience.
