# Blog post 7: The Youtube Algorithm

Do you remember the first video that you saw on Youtube? I certainly do. Back when I was a young
boy and lived in the ever-warm state of Hawaii, I was browing through some homepages on the website
Neopets. It was here that I stumbled upon an embedded youtube video of pokemon dancing to an at the
time popular slice of life anime, "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya." <br/><br/>

Youtube is a social media video sharing platform that popularised vlogging as well as viral videos.
Having been launched in early 2005, the website has seen a fair amount of changes in the past 14 years [DomainTools].
On of the largest changes is the user base. Youtube is an extremely successful, active site with over 
a billion users [Youtube]. However, this prestige does not come without challenges: in just one day, about 65 years
worth of videos are uploaded - that's 576k hours [Barker]!

With so much incoming content, it's impossible to ensure that each and every video follows the community guidelines.
The logical next step to solving this problem is to look towards technology: instead of limiting the amount of incoming 
videos or trusting the community to report videos that break the community's guidelines, Youtube employs an algorithm
that serves multiple purposes: detect videos that conflict the guidelines, detect and manages cases of copyright, decide
which videos are advertiser friendly, and reccomend videos for users to watch.

# The Algorithm
Youtube tries to be as transparent as possible when it comes to how its algorithms are implemented. In 2016, Youtube even
released a research paper on how Youtube researchers use deep neural networks to decide which videos to reccommend [Covington].
There are even courses created by Youtube and support pages detailing exactly how their system works [Youtube1, Youtube2].
Here is a table by Youtube that nicely encompass exactly what each policy entails:

|I'm interested in... | I should check out ...|
| Using a YouTube product or service | YouTube’s Terms of Service |
| Uploading content or commenting on a video | YouTube’s Community Guidelines |
| Understanding copyright ownership | YouTube’s Copyright website |
| Making videos visible to all ages | YouTube’s age-restricted content guidelines |
| Earning money on YouTube 	YouTube’s Partner Program policies |
| Creating content suitable for ads |	YouTube’s advertiser-friendly content guidelines |

The goal of these guidelines, courses, and support pages is to empower creators and improve the overall quality of 
the content that appears on the site. Nevertheless, theory rarely perfectly map out to practice.
Rather than empowering creators, many feel that Youtube's algorith is stifling, unfair, and most of all just plain
terrible.

Part of this comes from a prevalent feeling of uncertainly when unloading content. Regardless of how
transparent Youtube may be of their guidelines and policies, content creators have found and experienced
consequences that contradict these guidelines. Additionally, there are many grey areas that significantly
complicate how an algorithm views a video.

In Youtube's terms of service, point E of guideline 4 states prohibits commercial usage of a video that is
not original. This does not define what 'original' means -- what of the react channels that 'remix' a video
by basically reuploading a video and recording their reaction to the video for a profit? How about the numerous Russian
youtube channels that upload dubbed-over versions of videos and still gain ad revenue?

[IHE] Youtuber I Hate Everything explains the difference between transformative videos and basically stolen videos.<br/>

In the community guidelines, Youtube explains that users can flag content that appears to break policy or guidelines.
Accoring to them, each flagged video is judged on a case to case situation. This doesn't stop users from flagging
videos that do not deserve being flagged. Additionally, there are many videos that clearly infringe Youtube's policies and
law, yet they remain for a long period of time before any action from the side of Youtube takes place. For example,
- child abuse, exploitation, pornography

What Youtube wants - ignore algorithms, just be yourself. But this isn't working!
