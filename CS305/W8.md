# Technology for efficiency
-   Farming technology
-   Communication (writing, messaging)
-   Cars and airplanes instead of horeback travel

# Technology for simplicity
-   Fridge vs buying and carrying ice home or storing food underground
-   Driving automatic versus manual
-   Washing machine versus hand washing

<hr />

# One step too far
-   IDEs doing too much work for you?
-   Typing essays for you
-   machines that work out for you?

# The future ahead
-   Wal-e 
-   People don't know how to do things on their own anymore (kids playing, autonomus driving)
-   instant gratification
