## SiliVaccine

Twitter user Martyn Williams was sent an e-mail with and alleged North Korean antivirus software from 2013 attached 
and laced with additinal malware from a person claiming to work as a software engineer at a Japanese security company. 
Williams then forwarded the software, named *실리왁찐 (SiliVaccine)* to Checkpoint researchers, who took it to their
labs for research and analysis.

After analyzing the software, researchers discovered that about 25% of the antivirus
software's source code was identical to an older verson of a Japanese antivirus software: Trend Micoro. 
As for the remaining code, researchers found many bugs and conflicting functionality. For example, attempts 
to scan a file by right-clicking the file and selecting an option on the drop-down menu resulted in no activity.


In order to understand the purpose for such a software in a country like North Korea, it is important to understand
the current state of technology in the country. To give some background, in North Korea, technology is heavily 
controlled and regulated by government officials. North Korea has a firm hold on the access and type of media that 
citizens are able to access. The internet is banned widespread usage among North Korean citizens; instead North Korea 
makes use of an intranet that, in contrast to the outwardly, public-facing internet, is a private network isolated 
from other countries. 


With this in mind, it may seem baffling as to the reasons for which North Korea employs the usage of an antivirus - 
after all, if North Korean servers are blocked from the outside world and vice versa, then the potential for threat 
and cyber attack incidences should drop quite dramatically. Checkpoint researchers explained that the enclosed North 
Korean intranet is not immune to unwanted software as a result of the efforts of human rights organizations 
such as Flash Drives for Freedom who accept USB drive donations and smuggle these USBs across the border filled with 
western media such as wikipedia articles, Korean soap operas, more.

North Korea's control over the content that citizens are able to view raises an interesting question about the role
of government in regulating content shared over the internet. In the case of North Korea, where viewing banned 
material is punishable by public execution, governmental control is an obvious breach of rights. However, in places
outside of the DPRK, the ethics of regulating the internet is not so black and white.



## The Great Firewall of China [3]
Following suite in censorship of media, China is notorious for its usage of a strict firewall that restricts major
website such as Google, Facebook, and Youtube. On one hand, Chinese alternative platforms such as weibo and baidu
receive greater traffic and Chinese support. On the other hand, citizens and people travelling through China are
forced to go against Chinese law and use a VPN in order to bypass the firewall to access their e-mail on google or
watch the latest update from a youtube blogger. This is a huge roadbloack for minority group who seek community
and content from western sites, such as LGBT youth in China. [3]

Regulation of websites has some advantages: protecting national security from hate or terrorist groups, and
restricting access to website that sell illegal products or offer illegal services. However, when it is the 
government that has the final say on what gets goes or gets blocked, regulation becomes a slippery slope
that can lead to censorship of view critical of the current politics and propaganda. In fact, Google came
under fire last year for enabling China's restrictive firewall with work on Project Dragonfly.



## Project Dragonfly
Not too long after employees of Google protested the company's collaboration with the American military for using
artificial intelligence along with drones to identify human targts, the 
tech giant was placed under scrutiny once again for working with China on a search engine, named Dragonfly. [4] 
This variant of the google search engine would greatly expand the userbase and boost revenue for Google on the
condition that the engine agree with Chinese censorship laws and internet regulation. This would silence peaceful
protests or produce misleading results for topics that may cast the government in a bad light. Searching on such
asn engine for information on Tiananmen Square would return no result insteading the greusome reality of the 
government demolishing groups of protesters.

Google is not the only company guilty of interacting with China despite ethical concerns. After being banned in China
in 2009, Facebook has been attempting to develop relationships with Chinese companies to expand their market in
China. These attempts involve sharing data with Chinese companies such as Huawei - a company that is in close
contact with the Chinese government. Due to concerns of cyber espionage from microscopic cards on Huawei phones,
the company is now unofficially banned from being sold in America by large telcom companies like AT&T and Verizon. 



## Internet regulation in America
I believe that government regulation of a large platform for discussion and expressing one's opinions presents 
the potential for abuse of power and overregulation. Although *some* regulation is necessary to uphold current
laws against illegal activities like the circulation of child pornography, it is easy for regulation to hinder
free speech. The discussion over regulating the internet is especially concerning due to the natural state of 
the internet: ever changing and rapidly dynamic. Internet trends and jokes can sometimes last mere days before
changing focus to something completely different. 

It seems that there is a deficit in the discussion of internet regulation of lawmakers and government officials 
who are qualified and highly knowledgeable about the today's technology and the innerworkings of the internet.
Virtual space is new and can not be approached the same way as physical space. For example, copyright laws on 
youtube videos and laws regarding net neutrality stir mixed emotions amongst internet users, lawmakers, and companies.
Furthermore, decisions on regulation laws have the potential for setting positive or negative precedent, which 
will impact the way in which the Internet is controlled in the future.



## Future Steps

I believe that it is integral to promote discussion between organizations dedicated to technology and the internet,
and lawmakers. Active public discourse over future state of internet regulation should be held to include the 
various perspectives of not only businesses and corportations, but also users. The impact of regulation reaches
nearly every American, but it is unfathomable to expect every technology user to understand the details and 
implications of internet regulation.

However, there are a number of well-informed users such as content creators on youtube, website masters,
contributors to open source software, and podcast hosts, who could enlighten and provide advice to lawmakers 
for approching technology topics. The internet is a very powerful tool that is a part of the fabric of daily life
for many Americans, so I believe that decisions regarding its regulation should include voices from many Americans.
Regardless of how the future of regulation progresses, I hope that companies will better prioritize ethics
and humanity rather than threatening democracy for revenue.
