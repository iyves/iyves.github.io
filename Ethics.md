# CS305 - Ethical, Social, and Legal Implications of Computing

## On the topic of data control

A group of researchers from Checkpoint recently got ahold of an alleged North Korean antivirus software from 2013.
Twitter user Martyn Williams was sent an e-mail with the software attached and laced with additinal malware from 
a person claiming to work as a software engineer at a Japanese security company. Williams then forwarded the 
software to Checkpoint researchers.

After analyzing the software, researchers they discovered that about 25% of the antivirus
software's source code was identical to an older verson of a Japanese antivirus software, Trend Micoro. 
As for the remaining code, researchers found many bugs and conflicting functionality. For example, attempts 
to scan a file by right-clicking the file and selecting an option on the drop-down menu resulted in no activity.


To give some background, the current state of North Korean technology is heavily controlled and regulated by officials.
North Korea has a firm hold on the access and type of media that citizens are able to access. The internet is banned
widespread usage among North Korean citizens; instead North Korea makes use of an intranet that, in contrast to the
outwardly, public-facing internet, is a private network isolated from other countries. 


With this in mind, it may seem baffling as to the reasons for which North Korea employs the usage of an antivirus - 
after all, if North Korean servers are blocked from the outside world and vice versa, then the potential for threat 
and cyber attack incidences drop quite dramatically. something labs researchers explained that even the North 
Korean enclosed intranet is not immune to unwanted software with the efforts of human rights organizations 
such as Flash Drives for Freedom who accept USB drive donations and smuggle these USBs across the border filled with 
western media such as wikipedia articles, Korean soap operas, more.

North Korea's control over the content that citizens are able to view raises an interesting question about the role
of government in regulating content shared over the internet. In the case of North Korea, where viewing banned 
material is punishable by public execution, governmental control is an obvious breach of rights. However, in places
outside of the DPRK, the ethics of regulating the internet is not so black and white.
