# Yves Wienecke

## About me
Hello there! My name is __Yves__, it's pronounced like `wives`, but without the `w`. I know. It's *weird*, isn't it?

I am a third year student at Portland state university studying computer science and Russian. 

My hobbies include:
* Piano
* Dance
* Eating spicy food
* Knitting and crocheting
* Learning new skills
